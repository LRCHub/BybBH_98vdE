Flashing lights out of sight
Void of fear spreading within
Side to side, hiding from a black hole
Wall to wall, you crawl to trapfall

All that you lost, and all that you saved
You take it along, you take it away
All that you trust and all that you wait
It takes you alone, it takes you away

No way out, now way in, time is up, need to begin
